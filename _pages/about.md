I am a PhD student supervised by [Ke Li](https://www.math.ias.edu/~ke.li/) at Simon Fraser University in the department of computing science. I received my Master's degree from UC San Diego and Bachelor's degree in computer science from University of Toronto. My research interests are in generative models, 3D vision and machine learning.
