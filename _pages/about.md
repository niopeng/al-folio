I am a Master's student at UC San Diego in the department of CSE. I will be joining Simon Fraser University as a Ph.D. student under [Ke Li](https://www.math.ias.edu/~ke.li/) in Spring 2021. I received my bachelor's in computer science from University of Toronto in 2019. My research interests are in machine learning and computer vision.
