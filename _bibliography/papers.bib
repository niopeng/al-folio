      abstract={We consider problems where multiple predictions can be considered correct, but only one of them is given as supervision. This setting differs from both the regression and class-conditional generative modelling settings: in the former, there is a unique observed output for each input, which is provided as supervision; in the latter, there are many observed outputs for each input, and many are provided as supervision. Applying either regression methods and conditional generative models to the present setting often results in a model that can only make a single prediction for each input. We explore several problems that have this property and develop an approach that can generate multiple high-quality predictions given the same input. As a result, it can be used to generate high-quality outputs that are different from the observed output.}

abstract={Many tasks in computer vision and graphics fall within the framework of conditional image synthesis. In recent years, generative adversarial nets have delivered impressive advances in quality of synthesized images. However, it remains a challenge to generate both diverse and plausible images for the same input, due to the problem of mode collapse. In this paper, we develop a new generic multimodal conditional image synthesis method based on implicit maximum likelihood estimation and demonstrate improved multimodal image synthesis performance on two tasks, single image super-resolution and image synthesis from scene layouts. We make our implementation publicly available.},

abstract = {A common refrain heard by instructors of CS1 courses is ``I'm sure I did better than that" or ``I have no idea how I got that mark". Sometimes differences in a student's expected and reported marks may be due to a mistake on the part of the grader of the work, but more often than not this is an indicator that a student is not accurately assessing their own level of achievement on a piece of work. This may be an issue of capability (some students may lack the tools to assess what they have done correctly or incorrectly?) or one of confidence (some students are certain they are making mistakes even if they have done everything correctly). Regardless of the source of the gap between predicted and reported grades, it is an important skill for students to be able to accurately assess their own capabilities and performance.  In this work, we asked students in a CS1 course to predict their own grades on each question of their final examination. Analyzing the actual and predicted grades, and the differences between them leads to several interesting results. Poorer performing students are more likely to overestimate their grades, while better performing students are more likely to underestimate their grades. Furthermore, performance on the exam is strongly correlated with ability to correctly predict marks. Perhaps most interestingly, we found that while there was no difference in performance of male and female students on the exam, female students were more likely to under predict their performance than their male counterparts.},
